-- Write your SQL seed here. 

-- First, you'd need to truncate the table - this is so our table is emptied between each test run,
-- so we can start with a fresh state.

TRUNCATE TABLE recipes RESTART IDENTITY; -- replace with your own table name.

-- Below this line there should only be `INSERT` statements.
-- Replace these statements with your own seed data.
